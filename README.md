# Kidney_Stone_Detection_24
# ðŸ§  Kidney Stone Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses a trained **ResNet-50 model** to detect the presence of kidney stones from medical images. It features a user-friendly **Flask web application** for image upload, prediction, and doctor feedback.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Upload CT/ultrasound images of kidneys
- Detect kidney stone presence using deep learning
- Confidence-based severity interpretation and recommendations
- Doctors can submit feedback
- Built-in feedback storage
- Clean Bootstrap-based user interface

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python, Flask
- TensorFlow (ResNet-50)
- OpenCV & Pillow for image processing
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap 5)
